By keeping track of the things you have worked on you'll more likely remember what you did  and it is a great way to keep track of progress. It can also help tracking distractions and other things that hold you back from working on important stuff. This page describes a neat simple idea of using a simple text file to hold timestamped entries. The original idea I found  here.
Goals:

    keep a timestamped progress log
    simple read/write using the terminal
    no fancy GUI, no cloud stuff, just simple and distraction free

Idea: Keep a simple text file did.txt

Now we can use an editor to add a new line whenever we achieved something. But adding that timestamp can be quite tedious. Powerful Vim can help out with that! Vim allows to specify editing commands on the command-line that are being run after opening the file. For example, running the following goes to the end of the file, reads the current date and lastly, enters insert mode to append at the end of the line.

vim +'normal G' +'r!date +"\%F \%H:\%M:\%S: "' +'normal A' ~/did.txt

Define aliases for reading/writing

    did: to open the did.txt file with a pre-populated timestamp
    did_today: grep todays entries from the did.txt file

# Put this in your .bash_profile

alias did=vim +'normal G' +'r!date +"\%F \%H:\%M:\%S: "' +'normal A' ~/did.txt

alias did_today=grep $(date +%F) ~/did.txt
